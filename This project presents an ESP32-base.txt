This project presents an ESP32-based smart home
automation system integrated with both Alexa and
Google Assistant voice assistants. The system allows
users to control various home devices, such as lights,
appliances, and sensors, remotely using voice
commands.
The purpose of the esp32 smart home automation is to 
create a seamless and efficient way to control various
home devices using voice commands soo.....
we need a platform that can bind our ESP32 with
Google Assistant and Alexa, and for that, we have
used something called Sinric Pro.
